# üíµ Master Finance & Election Analysis in Python!

Glad to see you made it here!

## üé® Background

Welcome to Master Finance & Election Analysis in Python! You will showcase your Python skills through two intriguing challenges: PyBank and PyPoll. These challenges simulate real-world scenarios.

## üó∫Ô∏è Before You Begin

Before diving into the challenges, ensure you follow these steps:

1. Create a new repository named `python-challenge`.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Organize your work by creating separate folders for each Python assignment: `PyBank` and `PyPoll`.
4. In each folder, add the following components:
    - `main.py`: The main script for analysis!
    - `Resources`: Store the CSV files with the correct path in your script!
    - `Analysis`: Save analysis results in a text file within this folder!

## üè¶ PyBank Instructions

In the PyBank Challenge, unravel financial mysteries hidden in the `budget_data.csv` dataset. The script calculates:

- Total number of months
- Net total amount of "Profit/Losses"
- Changes in "Profit/Losses" over time and the average of those changes
- Greatest increase and decrease in profits, along with their respective dates and amounts

Example results:

    Financial Analysis
    ----------------------------
    Total Months: 86
    Total: $22,564,198
    Average Change: $-8,311.11
    Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1,862,002)
    Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1,825,558)

## üó≥Ô∏è PyPoll Instructions

In the PyPoll Challenge, modernize a small rural town's vote-counting process using the `election_data.csv` dataset. The script:

- Determines the total number of votes cast
- Compiles a list of candidates who received votes
- Calculates the percentage of votes each candidate won
- Ascertains the total number of votes each candidate won
- Identifies the election winner based on the popular vote

Example results:
    
    Election Results
    Total Votes: 369,711
    Charles Casper Stockham: 23.049% (85,213)
    Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272,892)
    Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11,606)
    Winner: Diana DeGette
